# DataCamp_DE

This repository contains adapted materials from the Data Engineering course offered by DataCamp. I have scraped instructions, questions, CSV data, and coding results from the course and adapted them into Jupyter Notebooks. This allows me to replay all the completed codes locally.

### Usage Instructions

- Only a few chapters are currently available in this repository. Additional chapters may be added in the future.
- To access the course materials, simply navigate to the respective chapter folder and run the provided `ipynb` file within.

### Note

Please note that the content in this repository is adapted from the Data Engineering course by DataCamp and is intended for personal use and reference only. All rights and credits for the original course materials belong to DataCamp.
